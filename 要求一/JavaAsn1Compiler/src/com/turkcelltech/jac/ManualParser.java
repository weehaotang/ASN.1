/**
 * This class was created to show manual decoding example of 
 * a "SEQUENCE OF/SET OF" object which holds CallDetailRecord.java objects
 * i.e. 
 * Pool ::= SEQUENCE OF CallDetailRecord
 * 
 * For "CallDetailRecord" look at the CallDetailRecord.java class under the "example_cdr" package
 * 
 * Such an object can also be decoded with AutoParser.
 * This is just an example to show.. Look "TestProject.java" to see usage of this class
 * 
 * -----------------
 * 
 * Another example is that :
 * if you will decode a SET OF or a SEQUENCE OF object which holds a tagged type
 * For example :
      MyInteger ::= [APPLICATION 76] INTEGER	--tagged type
      MySeqOf  ::= SEQUENCE OF MYINTEGER	-- SequenceOf that holds tagged types..
 * 
 * then create method should be overridden as:
 * 
   public BerNode create(int tag, BerInputStream stream) throws IOException
    {
		return new BerInteger(tag,stream);
	} 
	
	This also can be decoded automatically.
	This is only an example to show..
